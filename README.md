# WireInspection
Takes user input, calls an api to insert data into a no-sql database (mongo DB)  
Api is used to keep the client light weight  
To test, the server running the api must be started up (located in rest-api folder) through node.js npm start and the baseUrl variable must be changed to the localhost
ip address  
This problem can be solved by hosting the node.js server later on i.e. on Heroku
